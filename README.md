Prediction of Car Prices

1. Background:
Owning a car is a dream for most people, but not everyone can afford to buy a new one. In that case, used cars are an option.
Furthermore, several other factors influence people's decision to buy a used car: price depreciation, which is minor, the availability of papers, and the choice of car, which is more variable.

2. Problem Statement:
- For buyers: Determining whether used cars are worth the prices posted on online buying and selling forums is difficult.
A car's value can be affected by a number of factors, including distance, mileage, make, model, and transmission system.
- For sellers: It has become difficult for sellers to determine an appropriate price for a used car.

3. Business Goals:
Knowing the right price estimate on the market can alleviate the worry of determining the price, so creating a machine learning model that can predict the price range of used Audi cars will, of course, make it easier for consumers and sellers to determine the right price.Â
